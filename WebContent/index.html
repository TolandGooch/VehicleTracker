				<h3>Spring MVC C.R.U.D. (Week 7 Project)</h3>
				<p>Hello and welcome, I am Toland Gooch. This week’s project was 
				to development an interactive program that would use CRUD 
				(Create, read, update, and delete) method of Java and Spring 
				MVC. This was a solo project and I was tasked to select an 
				individual topic that I could develop. We were instructed to use 
				all the tools and skills that we had build upon since the first 
				day of the boot camp. I used a combination of programs and 
				technologies to complete this project. I used Java ( servlets 
				and JSPs) and used Spring MVC. Spring MVC is a 
				model-view-controller. Spring MVC allow me to use more flexible 
				and loosely coupled web applications to meet the task of this 
				project. I used Git as a version controller for my project and 
				GitHub as a place to store the changes as I updated of 
				refactored my project. I will be using Amazon AWS as a cloud 
				source to test and display my project. This project is light and 
				I in the future look to add additional items to this project 
				that I was not able to add at this time. With this project, the 
				data was stored in a .cvs file. I would like to build upon the 
				project once I have learned about databases. this will give the 
				project great capabilities and the information field could grow 
				to greater usability. As I typed in the code on the fly, I had 
				to make sure as I was coding to logically and continually think 
				about the actions I wanted the code to perform and how. This did 
				become a stumbling point for me as I had a most thing working be 
				a refactor caused others not to working. </p>

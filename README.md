Spring MVC C.R.U.D. (Week 7 Project)

Hello and welcome, I am Toland Gooch. This weekâ€™s project was to development an interactive program that would use CRUD (Create, read, update, and delete) method of Java and Spring MVC. This was a solo project and I was tasked to select an individual topic that I could develop. We were instructed to use all the tools and skills that we had build upon since the first day of the boot camp. I used a combination of programs and technologies to complete this project. I used Java ( servlets and JSPs) and used Spring MVC. Spring MVC is a model-view-controller. Spring MVC allow me to use more flexible and loosely coupled web applications to meet the task of this project. I used Git as a version controller for my project and GitHub as a place to store the changes as I updated of refactored my project. I will be using Amazon AWS as a cloud source to  test and display my project. This project is light and I in the future look to add additional items to this project that I was not able to add at this time. With this project, the data was stored in a .cvs file. I would like to build upon the project once I have learned about databases. this will give the project great capabilities and the information field could grow to greater usability. As I typed in the code on the fly, I had to make sure as I was coding to logically and continually think about the actions I wanted the code to perform and how. This did become a stumbling point for me as I had a most thing working be a refactor caused others not to working.
